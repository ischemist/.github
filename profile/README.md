> [science is constrained by infrastructure, not ideas](https://ischemist.com/writings/long-form/will-ai-transform-science)

we build production-grade infrastructure for the next generation of chemical intelligence. 

moving the field from "scripts that run once" to **reproducible, verifiable systems**.

### the protocol
we adhere to the [isChemist protocol](https://github.com/ischemist/protocol), a standard for rigor in computational science:

*   **principle i: verifiable truth.** no manual intervention. the path from raw data to asset is fully automated.
*   **principle ii: enduring utility.** the artifact is the truth. the paper is a pointer.
*   **principle iii: agentic inquiry.** internal locus of responsibility. commitment to the logos.

### artifacts
